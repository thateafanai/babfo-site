We do not collect, transmit, or have access to this data. It can typically be cleared by clearing the App's data in your device settings.<br><br>Information Processed by Third-Party Services (When You Initiate Action):<br>- WhatsApp: Launching WhatsApp via the Feedback screen or the Comment feature (e.g., to comment on a Scripture of the Day) uses the url_launcher package. Comments are sent to a designated WhatsApp number managed by the Apatani Baptist Association. Your interaction, including any comments you send, is governed by WhatsApp's Privacy Policy. We do not collect or store data from this interaction.<br>- Sharing: Using the Share button (e.g., to share a Scripture of the Day with text and image to apps like WhatsApp, Facebook, or Instagram) uses the share_plus package to invoke your device's native sharing function. The data shared depends on the app you choose, governed by that app's privacy policy (e.g., WhatsApp's Privacy Policy, Facebook's Privacy Policy, Instagram's Privacy Policy). We do not collect or store data from this interaction.<br><br>Technical &amp; Usage Information (Processed by Firebase): To help us fix bugs, understand how the App is used, and send push notifications, we utilize Google's Firebase services (Firebase Crashlytics, Firebase Analytics, and Firebase Cloud Messaging). These services may automatically collect certain information, including but not limited to:<br>- Crashlytics: Crash reports, including device state information (OS version, device model, orientation), unique application instance identifiers (pseudonymous), and stack traces related to crashes or errors within the App. This helps us diagnose and fix bugs.<br>- Analytics: Usage data (such as screens visited, session duration, feature usage patterns), device identifiers (like mobile advertising IDs, depending on your device settings and consent), general geographic location (e.g., country), and device information (model, OS version). This helps us understand user engagement and improve app features.<br>- Cloud Messaging (FCM): Device-specific FCM tokens to enable push notifications, device information (e.g., model, OS version), and notification interaction data (e.g., whether a notification was received or opened). We use FCM to send push notifications to inform you about new songs, updates, or other relevant information. These notifications may include images hosted on Firebase Storage. Data collected by Firebase services (Crashlytics, Analytics, and Cloud Messaging) is processed according to Google's Privacy Policy (https://policies.google.com/privacy) and Firebase-specific terms (https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy).<br><br>How We Use Information<br><br>- Locally stored settings/favorites are used only for App functionality on your device.<br>- Information from WhatsApp/Sharing is only used to initiate those actions.<br>- Crashlytics data is used solely for diagnosing and fixing bugs and improving App stability.<br>- Analytics data is used in an aggregated, anonymous, or pseudonymous way to understand usage patterns and make informed decisions about improving the App's features and user experience.<br>- FCM data (including device tokens) is used to send push notifications to your device. These notifications may include text and images to inform you about new content or updates.<br><br>Data Storage and Security<br><br>- User preferences and favorites are stored only locally on your device.<br>- Data collected by Firebase Crashlytics, Analytics, and Cloud Messaging is stored and processed by Google on their servers according to their security practices.<br><br>Data Sharing<br><br>- We do not sell or share your locally stored preferences or favorites list.<br>- Information collected by Firebase Crashlytics, Analytics, and Cloud Messaging is processed by Google as described in their privacy policies. We access this data in an aggregated or anonymized form for the purposes described above (bug fixing, usage analysis, and sending notifications). We do not share this raw data with other third parties, except as required by law or as described in Google's policies.<br>- Interactions initiated by you with third-party apps (WhatsApp, apps via the Share function) are subject to the policies of those third parties.<br>- Push notifications sent via FCM may include images hosted on Firebase Storage. These images are publicly accessible URLs to ensure they can be displayed in notifications, but we do not share any personal data with these images.<br><br>User Choices and Control<br><br>- You can clear locally stored preferences and favorites by clearing the App's data in your device's system settings.<br>- You can often limit ad tracking and the collection of certain device identifiers used by analytics services through your device's main settings (e.g., under Google settings or Privacy settings on Android).<br>- You can control push notifications through your device's notification settings. You can disable notifications for the App entirely or customize them (e.g., turn off sounds or banners). If you disable notifications, you will no longer receive push notifications from the App.<br><br>Children's Privacy<br><br>This App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 via the App or through Firebase services. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child may have provided information through Firebase, please contact us.<br><br>Changes to This Privacy Policy<br><br>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy here and updating the "Effective Date" at the top. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.<br><br>Contact Us<br><br>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us:<br><br>By email: thateafanai@babfo.org</p></div></article></main><div class="sidebar"><section class="box featured"><h3 class="box__title">Featured</h3><ul class="featured__container"><li class="featured__item"><div><a href="https://babfo.org/be-a-blessing-for-others-2/" class="featured__title">Be A Blessing For Others</a> <time class="u-small" datetime="2025-09-16T12:01">September 16, 2025</time></div></li></ul></section><section class="box authors"><h3 class="box__title">Authors</h3><ul class="authors__cotainer"><li class="authors__item"><div><a href="https://babfo.org/authors/thatea-fanai/" class="authors__title">Thatea Fanai</a> <span class="u-small">Post: 1</span></div></li></ul></section><section class="newsletter box box--gray"><h3 class="box__title">Newsletter</h3><p class="newsletter__description">Sign up to receive email updates and to hear what's going on with us!</p><form>...</form></section></div><footer class="footer"><a class="footer__logo" href="https://babfo.org/">BABFO</a><nav><ul class="footer__nav"></ul></nav><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Thank you for your visit - Be A Blessings For Others</p></div></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
